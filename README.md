This repository contains a short verification of a claim discussed in Appendix A of arXiv:2411.06929, specifically Eq. (A4), the streamline claim. It should be noted that an alternative proof exists in https://doi.org/10.1209/0295-5075/ace8b7, which also gives the requirement that the emergent magnetic field be divergenceless for the streamline claim to be true.

The derivation was carried out as part of undergraduate research with Prof. Jiadong Zang at the University of New Hampshire.

Status: Independent verification / derivation (not peer reviewed).
